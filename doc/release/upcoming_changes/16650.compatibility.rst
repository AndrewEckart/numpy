`np.genfromtxt` now correctly unpacks structured arrays
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously, `genfromtxt` failed to unpack if it was called with ``unpack=True``
and a structured datatype was inferred or passed to the ``dtype`` argument.

Structured arrays will now correctly unpack into a list of arrays,
one for each column::

    >>> np.genfromtxt(StringIO("1 2.0 \n 3 4.0"), unpack=True)
    [array([1, 3]), array([2., 4.])]]
