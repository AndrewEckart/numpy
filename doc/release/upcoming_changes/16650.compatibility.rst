`np.genfromtxt` now correctly unpacks structured arrays
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously, `genfromtxt` failed to unpack if it was called with ``unpack=True``
and a structured datatype was passed to the ``dtype`` argument
(or ``dtype=None`` was passed and a structured datatype was inferred).

Structured arrays will now correctly unpack into a list of arrays,
one for each column::

    >>> np.genfromtxt(StringIO("21 58.0 \n 35 72.0"), dtype=None, unpack=True)
    [array([21, 35]), array([58., 72.])]
